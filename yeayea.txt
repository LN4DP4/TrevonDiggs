Whithin the design of this page we have used many techneques to improve the effectivness of the design interface. 
First being the whitespace use which gives advantages such as more interacton to the website and in todays climate where
you have social media sites like tiktok where everyone is in a hurry to browes from one website to the next, 
white space can help by proventing distractions that slow visitors down. ANouther reason on why the use of white space is important
is whith the homepage of the website, everyone knows that first impressions are at the upmost of importants, with white 
space it gives the users an impression that GibJohn is a trust worthy, clean, modern proffetional site. i have also used 
white space importantly, on the students page as the whitespace highlights the important feature of that page including the Cources, profile picture a
and the student details.

Anouther techneuq that i have used would have to be the layout i desided to use a hibrid of many layouts comiding them to make the perfect web page
the first being The F layout used all of the login pages this gives the page an effective understanding of what the user must do
to continue on the site. we have also used the grid layout for the students and tutors dashboards which allows for equal viewing for 
all the information, it also makes the information easy to browes. The grid layout is good with comparing progress so that you can 
have better time manigment. 

The final techneuq that i have used would be common conventions, which are universal simularities between all websites such as the
logo placement being in the top right as well as a commonly used site navigation which is very important to be similar to other
websites as it eliminates the confusment of navigating through a website esppecially at a young age or old age. linking back to the 
layout, the use of the grid layout is very commonly used therefore when people come across it, they can understand what they are viewing more effietiently.
